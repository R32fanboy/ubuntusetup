# ubuntusetup
The files in this repository are simple bash scripts used to get ubuntu set up with the applications I use every day. Use setuproot.sh if you want to run as root and automate the install with no babysitting. Use setup.sh if you do not feel comfortable running a bash script as root (be warned you will most likely have to input your password multiple times.)
